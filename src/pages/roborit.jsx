                  Firefighting robots also known as vision guided robots, are
                  capable of detecting the fire and extinguishing it. Through
                  this hands-on workshop, you will learn to build your very own
                  fire fighting robot that uses digital IR sensors to detect the
                  fire and move in that direction to put it off using a DC fan.
                  To ease the programming learning experience, the course is
                  also equipped with scratch based block programming modules
                  that make programming the robot super easy even for beginners.
