                  Quizardry was altogether a 4-Quiz event which consisted of 4 rounds namely aptitude, technical affairs, pop culture and coding. Each round consisted of 20 questions on average and the cumulative scores of the 4 quizzes would be taken into consideration to decide the winner and the runner up.
                  <br></br>

                  The entire Student Branch of ComSoc was involved in the conduction of the event. We divided ourselves in 3 groups, where each group was involved in conducting a specific event being aptitude, technical affairs, or pop culture.

                  “Success Deck”- The flagship event of IEEE ComSoc, RITB is essentially a mock placement drive conducted especially for the 2nd and 3rd year engineering students to provide them with a basic idea of how college placements are conducted, the event not only helps them prepare for placements better but also gives a critical insight to all the participants in terms of improving on their technical and communication skills.
                  <br></br>
                  This event was conducted exactly like any placement drive that happens in our college; we conducted an aptitude followed by a coding round on 11th of December 2022 where they were posed with 3 medium level coding questions. We were extremely elated at the fact that more than 40 percent of the participants were scoring above 65 percent on the coding test showing that despite being in 2nd and 3rd year which showed how proficient students were at competitive coding.
                  <br></br>
                  For the technical interview round we bought in 4 astounding professionals from the tech industry who were also RIT Alumni. We shortlisted 10 candidates for the technical round and each round was approximately half an hour long judging the projects in their resume and their problem-solving capacity.
                  <br></br>
                  In the end the top or most impressive candidate was given a cash prize of 1500 INR (First Place), 1000 INR (Second Place), and 500 INR (Third Place) ; everyone was given a participation certificate.
